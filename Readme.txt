HLRconsole version 1.11b

This is just a protocol fix update for the steam version.

HLRconsole is a simple Visual Basic application i wrote when i used to run a counter-strike dedicated server at home.
Simply connects via RCON and can monitor and notify you when your attention is needed.  Commands can also be issued to the server via a console interface.

Advanced settings, editing hlrconsole and theme ini files.  Change them around to suit your needs, comes with a bark.wav to page you.
